# Hi there, I'm Hayyan! 👋

I am a final-year **Informatics Engineering** student at **Telkom University Purwokerto**, specializing in **AI Engineering** and **Full-Stack Development**.

I believe in working smart. My approach combines fundamental software engineering principles with **AI-Assisted Development** workflows. I focus on bridging the gap between complex AI models and real-world utility—moving from concept to deployment efficiently.



###  Featured Projects

Here are some of the production-ready projects I have built and deployed:

| Project | Tech Stack | Key Highlights |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Tanya UU Naker (RAG AI)](https://tanya-uu-naker.vercel.app/)** | **FastAPI, React, Gemini 2.0, Pinecone** | A Full-Stack **RAG** system for analyzing Indonesian Labor Law. **Developed using AI-assisted workflows** to accelerate the implementation of Context-Aware Memory, semantic search, and automatic citation features. |
| **[Phishing Detection 1D-CNN](https://phisingdetection1dcnnhayyan.netlify.app/)** | **TensorFlow, Python, Flask** | An end-to-end **Deep Learning** system using a **1D-CNN** architecture. Trained on a custom-balanced dataset to detect malicious URLs with **99% accuracy** on unseen test data. |
| **[Sistem Geospasial Brebes](https://hayyankomdigi.pythonanywhere.com/)** | **Flask, Python, Leaflet.js, SQL** | A WebGIS application developed during my internship at **Komdigi Brebes**. Digitized infrastructure data mapping to improve regional planning efficiency. |

####  Data Source Transparency
The **Tanya UU Naker** RAG system is strictly grounded on official legal documents to ensure accuracy and minimize hallucination:
* **Primary Source:** [UU No. 13 Tahun 2003 tentang Ketenagakerjaan](https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Details/43013/uu-no-13-tahun-2003)
* **Retrieval Scope:** 193 Articles (Pasal) parsed and indexed into Pinecone Vector Database.
